There are two projects where are studied two things using the same method but changing the conditions.
In the first, how certain states in the cells are propagated according to time and the probability of propagation and, in the second, according to
time with fixed propagation rules.
This study can be used to work out solutions when there's a propagation of a desease (project 1) or when you want to study the formation in certaint materials (project 2)
